/*
Package fetch provides a high-level interface for going out to get RSS and Atom feeds
from any source. Right now http and https requests are supported but future
implementations may also include authenticated fetchers, etc. Fetchers are intended to
synchronously make a single request to get the latest version the feed and to preserve
the state of the last request to the feed they are managing. They ensure that
connections are closed after each request use etag and last-modified headers to minimize
the amount of bandwidth required.

Basic Usage:

	fetcher := fetch.New("https://www.example.com/rss")
	feed, err := fetcher.Fetch()

// A package level http client for making requests. It is best practice to not use the
// default http.Client but to use your own with timeouts correctly specified. The
// package also admonishes us to only create one client for efficiency because the

// Fetcher provides a interface for anything that can get RSS data and provide it in a
// sequential fashion (e.g. without concurrency). The fetcher is the building block for
// larger subscription routines that periodically use the fetcher to retrieve data.
// Fetchers should therefore be treated as things that will only run inside of a single
// thread, whereas Subscription objects are things that may run concurrently.
